# resto
order your food using an app.

This repo contains an android studio project which builds an epic app. It loads the menu from an API and allows you to place an order, and it will even tell you when it will arrive.
The app uses an SQLite database to store what you would like to order.


To get this to run, you might need to press build -> clean project in Android Studio.

## Screenshots
Three screenshots of the app can be found in the doc folder.
